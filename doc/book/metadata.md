abstract: Multi-Processor System on Chip with ISA RISCV. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security.
